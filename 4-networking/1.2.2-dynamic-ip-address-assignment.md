### 1.2.2. Dynamic IP Address Assignment (DCHP Client)

To configure your server to use DHCP for dynamic address assignment, create a netplan configuration in the file `/etc/netplan/99_config.yaml`. The example below assumes you are configuring your first Ethernet interface identified as _enp3s0_.

```
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: netowkrd
  ethernets:
    enp3s0:
      dhcp4: true
```

The configuration can then be applied using the netplan command.

```
sudo netplan apply
```
